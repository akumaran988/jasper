# MCP Server Launcher

## Project Overview

The MCP Server Launcher is a core component within the Jasper ecosystem, designed to streamline the management and execution of various Jasper Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Think of it as a central control panel that can start, stop, and manage different specialized servers, ensuring that the right services are running when and where they're needed.

## Business Value

This project delivers significant value by:

*   **Simplifying Operations:** It provides a unified way to manage all Jasper MCP servers, reducing the complexity of launching and maintaining individual services. This means less manual intervention and a lower risk of configuration errors.
*   **Enhancing Scalability & Flexibility:** By acting as a launcher, it supports easy deployment and scaling of various services. New MCP servers can be integrated and managed without extensive reconfigurations.
*   **Improving Reliability:** Automated management capabilities contribute to more stable and reliable service uptime, which is crucial for business-critical applications relying on the Jasper platform.
*   **Developer Efficiency:** Developers can quickly spin up and manage necessary services in different environments (local, staging, production) with standardized commands, accelerating development cycles.

## Key Capabilities

*   **Universal Server Management:** Capable of launching any Jasper MCP server package.
*   **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Supports starting services in different modes (e.g., local, remote, production) with specific port and authentication requirements.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides a robust CLI for easy interaction and scripting, allowing for programmatic control over server instances.
*   **Service Integration:** Built to integrate seamlessly with other Jasper services, including the Service Manager and Model Context Protocol SDK.

## Technology Stack (for context)

This project is built using modern and widely adopted technologies:

*   **TypeScript/Node.js:** Provides a robust and scalable backend environment.
*   **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for handling API requests.
*   **Commander.js:** A powerful tool for building command-line interfaces.
*   **MCP SDK:** Integration with the Model Context Protocol Software Development Kit facilitates interaction with other MCP-compliant services.

## Getting Started (Technical Summary)

For technical teams, the project includes scripts for building (`npm run build`), running in development mode (`npm run dev`), and starting the compiled application (`npm run start`). Specific commands are available to launch the Service Manager in various configurations.
