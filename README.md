# Jasper Project

An intelligent terminal AI assistant with advanced tool calling capabilities.

## Project Structure

- `.claude/`: Contains IDE configurations and project-specific settings.
- `.env`, `.env.example`: Environment variable configuration files. `.env.example` serves as a template.
- `.git/`: Standard Git repository directory.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (e.g., `node_modules`, logs).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `dist/`: Directory for compiled or built JavaScript files from TypeScript.
- `jasper.config.json.example`: An example configuration file for the Jasper project, likely to be copied and modified.
- `logs/`: Directory intended for storing log files generated by the application.
- `node_modules/`: Contains all the project's npm dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`, `package.json`: npm package management files, defining project dependencies and scripts.
- `src/`: Contains the original TypeScript source code for the project.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration file.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Jasper
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file and fill in your specific details.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your API keys and other configurations
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, use the following npm scripts:

-   `npm start`: To run the application in production mode (compiled).
-   `npm run dev`: To run the application in development mode using `tsx` (enables hot-reloading).
-   `npm run build`: To compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript (output to `dist/`).
-   `npm run debug`: To run the application in debug mode with logging.

*Specific usage instructions will depend on the core functionality of the Jasper project. Please refer to the `src/` directory for detailed implementation or consult any additional documentation provided within the project.*

## Development Workflow

The following commands are available for development:

### Running the application locally

To start the development server, which often includes hot-reloading for faster development cycles:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building the project

To compile the TypeScript source code into JavaScript (output to the `dist/` directory):

```bash
npm run build
```

### Debugging the application

To run the application in debug mode, which logs output to `logs/jasper.log`:

```bash
npm run debug
```

### Running tests

To execute the project's test suite:

```bash
npm test
```
*(Note: If specific test scripts are defined in `package.json`, adjust the command accordingly.)*

### Linting and Formatting

The project is configured with ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting to maintain code quality and consistency. To run the linter:

```bash
npm run lint
```
To run the formatter:

```bash
npm run format
```
*(Ensure you have these scripts defined in your `package.json`.)*
